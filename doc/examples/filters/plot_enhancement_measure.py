Quantitative Measure of Image Enhancement
=========================================

In this example, we will quantify the effect of applying contrast enhancement
to an image using a measure called EME [1]_.

It is defined as a log of the ratio of local maximum to local minimum
<<<<<<< HEAD
within a sliding window. The code allows the user to choose the window size.
This function was defined to quantify improvement of the image
after processing.
=======
within a sliding window of given size.
This measure aims to provide a perceptual estimate of image quality, useful when comparing image enhancement algorithms.

# We will create a function that takes an original image as `before`
# and applies a `transform` to it. We will use a gaussian filter to
# strongly blur the image and an adaptive histogram equalization as
# transforms.

############################################################################
# You can see that the greyscale camera image is very blurred due to
# strong gaussian filtering. This resulted in smoothing a lot of pixel
# differences and, as a result, to lower value of EME.
# On the other hand, the `astronaut` image was enhanced by adaptive
# histogram equalization with `256*3` bins. Histogram equalization
# brought out details and the EME value is higher than before the transform.
