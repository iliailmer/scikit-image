=========================================
Quantitative Measure of Image Enhancement
=========================================

In this example, we will measure the result of applying contrast enhancement
to the image. We will use a measure called EME [1]_.

It is defined as a log of the ratio of local maximum to local minimum
within a sliding window. The code allows the user to choose the window size.
This function was defined to quantify improvement of the image after processing.

# We will create a function that takes an original image as `before`
# and applies a `transform` to it. We will use a gaussian filter to
# strongly blur the image and an adaptive histogram equalization as
# transforms.

    after = transform(before, **kwargs)

# You can see that the greyscale camera image is very blurred due to
# strong gaussian filtering. This resulted in smoothing a lot of pixel
# differences and, as a result, to lower value of EME.
# On the other hand, the `astronaut` image was enhanced by adaptive
# histogram equalization with `256*3` bins. Histogram equalization
# brought out details and the EME value is higher than before the transform.
